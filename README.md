# MATLAB-pump-relay
A student project for ENGR114 at Portland Community College. Uses MATLAB and an Arduino connected over serial to switch on and off a pump using a relay.

## Problem Statement
We will create a user input controlled pump. This will be controlled via the command line in MATLAB, which will be accessed through a laptop near the garden. The program will ask the user if they want to turn the pump on or off. It will ignore inputs that do not correspond to either of these actions. If the pump is already on, and they select to turn it on, it will inform the user that it is on, and vice versa if the pump is off.
